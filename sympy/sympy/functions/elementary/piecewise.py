    Represents a piecewise function.

    Usage:

      Piecewise( (expr,cond), (expr,cond), ... )
        - Each argument is a 2-tuple defining an expression and condition
        - The conds are evaluated in turn returning the first that is True.
          If any of the evaluated conds are not determined explicitly False,
          e.g. x < 1, the function is returned in symbolic form.
        - If the function is evaluated at a place where all conditions are False,
          a ValueError exception will be raised.
        - Pairs where the cond is explicitly False, will be removed.

    Examples
    ========

    >>> from sympy import Piecewise, log, ITE, piecewise_fold
    >>> from sympy.abc import x, y
    >>> f = x**2
    >>> g = log(x)
    >>> p = Piecewise((0, x < -1), (f, x <= 1), (g, True))
    >>> p.subs(x,1)
    1
    >>> p.subs(x,5)
    log(5)

    Booleans can contain Piecewise elements:

    >>> cond = (x < y).subs(x, Piecewise((2, x < 0), (3, True))); cond
    Piecewise((2, x < 0), (3, True)) < y

    The folded version of this results in a Piecewise whose
    expressions are Booleans:

    >>> folded_cond = piecewise_fold(cond); folded_cond
    Piecewise((2 < y, x < 0), (3 < y, True))

    When a Boolean containing Piecewise (like cond) or a Piecewise
    with Boolean expressions (like folded_cond) is used as a condition,
    it is converted to an equivalent ITE object:

    >>> Piecewise((1, folded_cond))
    Piecewise((1, ITE(x < 0, y > 2, y > 3)))

    When a condition is an ITE, it will be converted to a simplified
    Boolean expression:

    >>> piecewise_fold(_)
    Piecewise((1, ((x >= 0) | (y > 2)) & ((y > 3) | (x < 0))))
